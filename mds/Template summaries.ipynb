The metacontroller is a model-free reinforcement learning agent that selects how many optimization iterations and what function or \\u201cexpert\\u201d to consult from a fixed set (such as an action-value or state transition function). Experimental results are presented from simulation experiments where a spacecraft must fire its thruster once to reach a target location, in the presence of between 1 and 5 heavy bodies.----------------The metacontroller system has a similar performance loss on the one-shot learning task as an iterative (standard) optimization procedure. However, by taking into account the computational complexity of running a classical, iterative optimization procedure as a second \\u201cresource loss\\u201d term, the metacontroller is shown to be more efficient. Moreover, the metacontroller agent successfully selects the optimal expert to consult, rather than relying on an informed choice by a domain-expert model designer. The experimental performance is a contribution that merits publication, and it also exhibits the use of an interaction network for learning the dynamics of a simulated physical system. The dataset that has been developed for this task also has the potential to act as a new baseline for future work on one-shot physical control systems. The dataset constitutes an ancillary contribution which could positively impact future research in this area.----------------Cons:--------It's not clear how this approach could be applied more broadly to other types of optimization. Moreover, the REINFORCE gradient estimation method is known to suffer from very high variance, yielding poor estimates. I'm curious what methods were used to ameliorate these problems and if any other performance tricks were necessary to train well. Content of this type this could form a useful additional appendix.----------------A few critiques on the communication of results:----------------- The formal explication of the paper\\u2019s content is clear, but Fig.\\u2019s 1A and 3 could be improved. Fig. 1A is missing a clear visual demarcation of what exactly the metacontroller agent is. Have you considered a plate or bounding box around the corresponding components? This would likely speed the uptake of the formal description.----------------- Fig. 3 is generally clear, but the lack of x-axis tick marks on any subplots makes it more challenging than necessary to compare among the experts. Also, the overlap among the points and confidence intervals in the upper-left subplot interferes with the quantitative meaning of those symbols. Perhaps thinner bars of different colors would help here. Moreover, this figure lacks a legend and so the different lines are impossible to compare with each other.----------------- Lastly, the second sentence in Appendix B. 2 is a typo and terminates without completion.\",\n          \"This paper addresses the issue of how to evaluate automatic dialogue responses. This is an important issue because current practice to automatically evaluate (e.g. BLEU, based on N-gram overlap, etc.) is NOT correlated well with the desired quality (i.e. human annotation). The proposed approach is based on the use of an LSTM encoding of dialogue context, reference response and model response with appropriate scoring, with the essence of training one dialogue model to evaluate another model. However, the proposed solution depends on a reasonably good dialogue model to begin with, which is not guaranteed, rendering the new metric possibly meaningless. \",\n          \"The paper addresses the important problem (d>>n) in deep learning. --------The proposed approach, based on lower-dimensional feature embeddings, is reasonable and makes applying deep learning methods to data with large d possible.--------The paper is well written and the results show improvements over reasonable baselines.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gold\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 97,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Modeling nonlinear interactions between variables by imposing Tensor-train structure on parameter matrices is certainly an elegant and novel idea.

Evaluation is an extremely important question that does not get enough attention in the machine learning community, so the authors' effort is welcomed. The task that the authors are trying to evaluate is especially hard; in fact, it is not even clear to me how humans make these judgments. The low kappa scores on some of the non-\\\"overall\\\" dimensions, and only moderate agreement on \\\"overall,\\\" are quite worrisome. What makes a good \\\"chat\\\" dialogue? The authors seem not to have qualitatively grappled with this key question, rather defining it empirically as \\\"whatever our human judges think it is.\\\" This is, I think the deepest flaw of the work; the authors are rushing to automate evaluation without taking the time to ponder what good performance actually is.     That aside, I think the idea of automatic evaluation as a modeling problem is worth studying. The authors note that this has been done for other problems, such as machine translation. They give only a cursory discussion of this prior work, however, and miss the seminal reference, \\\"Regression for sentence-level MT evaluation with pseudo references,\\\" Albrecht, Joshua, and Rebecca Hwa, ACL 2007.    The paper would be much stronger with some robustness analysis; does the quality of the evaluation hold up if the design decisions are made differently, if less data are used to estimate the evaluation model, etc.? How does it hold up across datasets, and across different types of dialogue systems? As a methodological note, there are a lot of significance tests here and no mention of any attempt to correct for this (e.g., Bonferroni, FDR, etc.).    As interesting as the ideas here are, I can't see the dialogue community rushing to adopt this approach to evaluation based on the findings in this paper. I do think that the ideas it presents should be hashed out in a public forum sooner rather than later, and therefore recommend it as one of a few papers to be presented at the workshop.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}],"source":["df = prepare_dataset('reviews')\n","\n","# for n, group in df.groupby('id'):\n","#     for idx, row in group.iterrows():\n","#         print(row['text'].replace('-----', \"\\n\"))\n","#         print(\"===========\")\n","#     break\n","df"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"id":"7fe212dd-63d2-44b1-b06e-7792b9d504ac","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"7fe212dd-63d2-44b1-b06e-7792b9d504ac","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739019282724,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Stefano Gamba","userId":"08500087636985262916"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","\n","for n in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:\n","    for file in path.glob(\"*.pk\"):\n","        print(file)\n","        with file.open('rb') as fd:\n","            data = pk.load(fd)\n","\n","        Path(output_path).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n","        model_name, dataset_name, decoding_config, date = str(file.stem).split('-_-')[:4]\n","\n","        dataset = prepare_dataset(dataset_name, dataset_path=\"data/test/\")\n","        dataset = dataset.set_index('id')\n","\n","        fn = lambda sample: consensus_scores_based_summaries(sample, n_consensus=n, n_dissensus=n)\n","\n","        df = construct_templated_summaries(data, fn, dataset=dataset)\n","\n","        df['metadata/method'] = \"Agreement\"\n","        df['metadata/n_sentences'] = 2*n\n","        df['metadata/n_consensus'] = n\n","        df['metadata/n_dissensus'] = n\n","\n","        name = file.stem + \"-_-\" + f\"consensus_score_based_{n}.csv\"\n","\n","        if (output_path / name).exists():\n","            df_old = pd.read_csv(output_path / name)\n","\n","            for col in df.columns:\n","                if col not in df_old.columns:\n","                    df_old[col] = float(\"nan\")\n","\n","            #
